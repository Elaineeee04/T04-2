    <h1>Televisions Energy Consumption</h1>

      <h2>Understanding the Energy Rating Label</h2>
      <p>The Energy Rating Label is a mandatory label on most new appliances sold in Australia. For televisions, it helps you compare the energy efficiency of different models. The label shows two key pieces of information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Star Rating:</b> The more stars on the label, the more energy-efficient the television is. A higher star rating means lower running costs and a smaller environmental impact.</li>
        <li><b>Energy Consumption:</b> This number, measured in kilowatt-hours per year (kWh/year), indicates the estimated annual energy consumption. The lower the number, the better.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Always compare the energy consumption of televisions with a similar screen size, as larger TVs will naturally use more energy.</p>

      <h2>How to Calculate Your TV's Energy Cost</h2>
      <p>You can estimate your television's energy consumption and annual running cost using a simple formula. You will need your TV's estimated annual energy consumption from its Energy Rating Label (in kWh/year) and your electricity cost per kWh.</p>
      
      <div class="calculation-formula">
        <h3>Estimated Annual Cost Formula:</h3>
        <p><b>Annual Cost ($)</b> = (Annual Energy Consumption (kWh) × Electricity Cost (cents per kWh)) / 100</p>
      </div>

      <p>For example, if a TV's Energy Rating Label shows an annual consumption of 150 kWh and your electricity cost is 30 cents per kWh, the calculation would be:</p>
      <p>(150 kWh × 30 cents) / 100 = $45</p>
      <p>Your estimated annual running cost for that TV would be $45.</p>

      <h2>Tips to Reduce TV Energy Consumption</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Adjust Brightness:</b> Lowering the brightness of your TV can significantly reduce its energy use.</li>
        <li><b>Use Sleep Timers:</b> If you often fall asleep while watching, set a sleep timer to automatically turn the TV off.</li>
        <li><b>Unplug or Use a Power Strip:</b> Televisions consume a small amount of "standby" power even when turned off. Unplugging it or using a power strip you can switch off will eliminate this.</li>
        <li><b>Enable Eco-Modes:</b> Many modern TVs have "Eco" or "Energy Saving" modes that automatically adjust settings to optimize for lower energy consumption.</li>
      </ul>
